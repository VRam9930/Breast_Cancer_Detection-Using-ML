# Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

🔬 **A machine learning-based classification model for breast cancer detection using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Breast cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases among women worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment. This project develops a **machine learning model** that classifies breast cancer tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)**.

## 📊 Dataset Description  
We use the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)**, which consists of **569 samples** with **30 features** extracted from cell nuclei images.

- **Target Labels**:  
  - `Malignant (1)` → Cancerous  
  - `Benign (0)` → Non-cancerous

## 🔥 Machine Learning Workflow  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handle missing values, duplicate data, and feature scaling.  
2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualize the dataset to understand feature distributions.  
3️⃣ **Feature Selection**:  
   - Select the most relevant features for classification.  
4️⃣ **Model Training & Evaluation**:  
   - Train multiple ML models (`Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.`) and compare performance.  
5️⃣ **Model Deployment (Optional)**:  
   - Save and load the best model for predictions.
